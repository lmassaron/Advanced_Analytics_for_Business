# README for Lightning Flash basics repo

Repo for upcoming Manning book on machine learning for tabular data. 

This repo contains a Lightning Flash solution to prediction of [Airbnb NYC listing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). The solution is based on the [fastai-based solution](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/fastai_basics) with the following changes in the [model training](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/fastai_basics/blob/master/notebooks/model_training.ipynb) notebook:
- replace data preparation for fastai with Lightning Flash data preparation
- replace fastai model definition & training in model training notebook with Lightning Flash model definition & training

This solution also uses information from the article [Tabular Classification and Regression Made Easy with Lightning Flash](https://pub.towardsai.net/tabular-classification-and-regression-made-easy-with-lightning-flash-d33bea76a645).
